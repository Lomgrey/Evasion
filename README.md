# Evasion
A simple game written with Java and JavaFX. App don't have a dependencies so for running it you're just need have a Java 8 or higher. <br />
 <br />
In game you're need dodge enemies by moving a circle. The longer you last, the more points you get.<br />

### Getting points rules
If you're choose a 'Easy' level then enemies will spawn less and have low speed, but points will grow up very slow too.  <br />
If you're choose a 'Hard' level then points will grow up pretty fast, but speed of enemies will grow up proportionally with count of your points.  <br />
A 'Normal' level it is obviously a something middle between Easy and Hard. Enemies speed is constant but pretty fast.<br />
